A Dance of Fire and Ice is a simple one-button rhythm game. Keep your focus as you guide two orbiting planets down a path without breaking their perfect equilibrium. It's pretty hard to describe, but you should play the free online version on a desktop computer first if you are not sure you would enjoy this game!
